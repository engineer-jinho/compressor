# Throughput Control

용어
  - Throughput Control: Capacity control or process control
  - control object: process setpoint

정의: Throughput control is achieved by controlling the energy input to the compressor in order to reach the control object

Control Methods
  - speed, IGV, suction throttling valve, discharge valve throttling

Stream turbine vs Gas tubine vs Eletric motor vs gear driven


## SPEED CONTROL

압력제어: Increasing motor speed -> curve move to the right -> increasing flow @ constant pressure
유량제어: Increasing motor speed -> curve move to the right -> increasing pressure @ constant flow

모터 속도를 직접 제어해서 Set value를 맞추는 방식이다.
process set value가 압력이면, 압력을 일정하기 위해 유량을 변동시키고,
process set value가 유량이면, 유량을 일정하기 위해 압력을 변동시킨다.


## suction valve throttling

restricting gas flow and pressure into the inlet

입구쪽 가스 유량 및 압력을 제한하는 것으로 On/Off 제어이다.


Closing discharge vale -> decreased suction flow       -> Raising demand load curve 
Closing discharge vale -> decreased discharge pressure -> Raising demand load curve


## discharge valve throttling

- restricting pressure from the compressor to match the process pressure at constant flow.
- 거의 사용하지 않는다.

Closing discharge vale -> decreased suction flow       -> Raising demand load curve 
Closing discharge vale -> increased discharge pressure -> Raising demand load curve



## Variable guide vane control

VGV or IGV
only for dynamic compressor types.
counter-rotation vs pre-rotation

Closing discharge vale -> decreased suction flow       -> lower charateristic curve 
Closing discharge vale -> decreased discharge pressure -> lower charateristic curve

Max position -> Max counter-rotation
Min position -> Max pre-rotation

The use of pre-rotation is more efficientcy at low loads
